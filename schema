Project_update --- updates, materials, comments, rates
User --- hometown, interests, credit card, etc , post comments on projects, and pledge funds for a project. post new projects and ask for funds for these projects.
Projects should probably have a name and description, and maybe some tags or category labels, and owners of projects should be able to add new entries with updates about the project, containing text and multimedia data (mp3s, pictures, movies) about the project

When a project is successfully funded, a charge to the credit cards of the sponsors should be created and recorded.
Users should be able to like a project, and should be able to follow other users. That way, users can easily see all the comments, pledges, and likes of the users that they follow.
